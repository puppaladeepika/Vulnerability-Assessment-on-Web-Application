Report: Utilization of Technologies, Memory Requirements, Tools, and Algorithms

Utilization of Technologies:

1. Programming Language: Python 3.x
2. Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup and requests libraries for HTML parsing and HTTP requests
3. Vulnerability Scanning: Custom checks for SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)
4. Web Browser Automation: webbrowser module for opening URLs in a web browser

Memory Requirements:

1. RAM: Minimum 4 GB recommended for smooth execution
2. Storage: Approximately 100 MB for the Python script and dependencies

Tools:

1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Any Python-compatible IDE (e.g., PyCharm, Visual Studio Code)
2. Web Browser: Any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
3. Python Libraries:
    - requests
    - BeautifulSoup
    - webbrowser
    - re (regular expressions)

Algorithms:

1. Vulnerability Scanning:
    - SQL injection detection using regular expressions
    - XSS detection by injecting malicious scripts
2. Web Scraping:
    - HTML parsing using BeautifulSoup
    - URL joining and normalization using urllib.parse
3. Exploitation:
    - Manual exploitation of SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities using webbrowser module

Additional Notes:

1. The script uses a combination of automated scanning and manual testing for vulnerability assessment.
2. The memory requirements are minimal, making it suitable for most modern systems.
3. The script can be extended to include additional vulnerability checks and exploitation techniques.
4. You can also perform this vulnerability assessment using various automated tools like burpsuite, nmap, nessus etc..,
